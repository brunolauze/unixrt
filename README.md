Unix RT System
======

Unix RT System plans to create a new distribution of FreeBSD with new technologies in mind, removing KDE and Gnome from the way, the goal is to introduce a new interface based on mono and webkit2.
With mono and webkit2, and some C# glue code, the UI system would be a mix of WinRT API-like and Chrome OS development.
